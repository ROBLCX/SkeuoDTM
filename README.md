### A Skeuomophic Theme for Discord.

SkeuoDTM is a combination of [DTM-08](https://github.com/XYZenix/XYZenixThemes/), [DTM-12](https://github.com/XYZenix/XYZenixThemes/) and [SkeuoCord](https://github.com/Marda33/SkeuoCord/). It is designed to give Discord's UI a skeuomophic look and feel. Combining two themes together for the best look.
